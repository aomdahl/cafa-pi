# Analytics Progress

- Encoded protein sequences and GO-IDs into one-hot encoding
    - to make it readable for a machine learning model
- Generated synthetic data set
    - created to make sure it works on a simplified version of our problem
- Wrote a simple, perceptron model and ran it on synthetic data set
    - to get a rough draft of a working model
    - TensorFLow: good visualization
- Next Steps
    - try model on more than 2 classes
    - run on bigger dataset
